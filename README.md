# Social-Buzz-Data-Analytics
Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content.
There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments.
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds.
The objective of the project is an analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity
